# Magic 8 Ball 

## Overview
Welcome to my first solo JavaScript project! This simple Magic 8 Ball is a digital version of the iconic fortune-telling toy. Users can ask a yes-or-no question, shake the ball, and receive a randomly generated answer.

## Features
- Click the shake button to shake and reveal your fortune.
- Receive a random response from the pre-defined answers.
- Responsive design allows the Magic 8 Ball to be used on all device sizes!

## Testing Integration 
At a later stage in my coding journey, I revisited my Magic 8 Ball project to incorporate Playwright testing. This decision was motivated by my desire to explore and gain proficiency in utilising their software.
